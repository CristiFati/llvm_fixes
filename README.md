# llvm_fixes
Fixes for llvm (http://llvm.org)


*llvm* (at least the binary packages on some platforms) seems to be buggy.

This repo's goal is to provide fixes that can quickly get around some of the bugs.

Note that mainly, **the effect is fixed, and not the root cause!**

Check *Notes.md* (in appropriate branches) for more details.
